# Timer
A small timer app that I use to track my time worked


There are two options for timers - the legacy (and now deprecated) tkinter version in the root of the repository, and the (suggested) Qt version in qt_timer.


## Usage
Either run the timer.py file with python, or use the released .EXE file. The Qt timer should be run from the same folder as "config.toml"
